00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.100
Hey guys, how's it going? My name is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.999
Andrew and welcome back to my studio.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.056
So today now that we've learned how to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:16.766
mouthpiece Buzz, we're going to learn

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.350
how to match pitch on the mouthpiece.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.926
So go ahead, take your mouthpiece rubber,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.180
hold it with your non writing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359
hand and we're going to play.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.086
What is AG? On the trumpet.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.542
So if you don't know how

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:33.588
to play a G on the trumpet,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.327
it's open and you can play it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8161488

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.740
I guess.

NOTE Confidence: 0.76083255

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.177
If you don't have the range to

NOTE Confidence: 0.76083255

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.698
play that on the trumpet yet,

NOTE Confidence: 0.76083255

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.959
you can always take a piano like I have

NOTE Confidence: 0.76083255

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.117
back here and find where F is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.76083255

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.938
And play that and that is

NOTE Confidence: 0.7279511

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.054
your G. So the process for doing

NOTE Confidence: 0.7279511

00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:55.180
this, you're going to hum the G.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8638024

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.255
And then you're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8638024

00:00:58.255 --> 00:00:59.060
play it on a mouthpiece.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87142396

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.784
And hold it out for a few seconds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87142396

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.317
Rest for a few seconds in between.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87142396

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.440
Sing it again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87142396

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.920
And a mouthpiece puzzled again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109486

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.520
Now, if you end up hitting a note too low,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109486

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.628
let's say you sing this note.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109486

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.956
Uh, but that doesn't sound like the G, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109486

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:35.440
Well, you're too low so firm up a little bit,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109486

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.778
and then push a little bit with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109486

00:01:37.778 --> 00:01:40.296
the air just a little bit to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109486

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:45.210
help raise that pitch. Ohh uh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9125737

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.370
Now, if you're too high. Ohhh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83312845

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.868
What you want to do is you

NOTE Confidence: 0.83312845

00:01:57.868 --> 00:01:59.100
want to relax in the middle,

NOTE Confidence: 0.83312845

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530
so let your the center of your

NOTE Confidence: 0.83312845

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.756
lips relax just a little bit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83312845

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:05.480
Maybe drop your jaw just slightly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83312845

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.130
To make that pitch go down. Ohh

NOTE Confidence: 0.83913684

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.104
but the end result we want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.83913684

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:18.418
come in right on that sheet.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.450
You can do this on any note you want to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.926
I would recommend don't go too

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:29.230
high right off the beginning

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.078
and don't go too low right away.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.128
Both of those extremes are hard to do,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.666
especially when we're first learning trumpet.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.469
So find something in a comfortable register.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.855
If you're reading music and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:39.240
doing this somewhere towards the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:40.590
bottom of the staff for now,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.160
but we will talk about that in a later video,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8291699

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.464
